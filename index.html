        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Think: "Aesthetic and Design" code</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
          <li>The .card element forms a box</li>
          <li>Don't be silly, check online for style tutorials & don't get in over your head</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Think: A version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code. Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
          <li>git checkout switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory</li>
          <li>git commit -m “[descriptive message]” commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Don't be silly, keep track of branches! You can lose everything and have to do this again and be very visably upset and hard to be around.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Think: the joints and muscles of the sites body (Functionality)</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the "var" keyword. After the "var" keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator "=" to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>the "script.js" file is linked within the body element of a HTML document.</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An "if" statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>Use "else if" when theres more than one condition</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>Don't be silly, theres more to be explored on the subject, check back soon!</li>
