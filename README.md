# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Motive: To create a webpage with information on materials covered in prologue of my full-stack bootcam journey.

Why?: The easy answer is to prove im capable of doing it. The more complex answer lies within convienence; lets say class starts and for whatever reason an open book quiz comes before you on your computer screen, teacher promting you to answer questions on a quiz using your OWN study guide. This was made to be given the feeling off having an "upper-hand".

Problems Solved: Just as stated above, having this in a convienent place solves alot of issues one could encounter. The greatest probelm this project attacks and conquers is the beast that is "Understanding any of this information" if you were never familiar in the first place. If a kid can get it so can you kinda vibe but with a lil more education in the mix.

What i've learned: Organization is important. Everything you love is finite, storing your precious files blindley all over your pc is dangerous and will ruin your day when you go to push something and everything goes kaputt cause you didnt respect the branches and file placement in your pc. NGL, that shit crushed me. Like sad music playlist running for 3 hours just to force tears after crying from the confusion of where you went wrong in the first place. Oh, the answer to that? My goofy begginner self didnt realize my OG terminal and Bash are not one in the same. Ignorance to small details led to ginormous problems. If that ain't a life lesson... anywho thank you for reading all of this. much love <3
